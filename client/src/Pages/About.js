        The goal of the project would be to create a system for saving and accessing game data on a computer in a way that is efficient and effective. In this project, We worked together to explore the various options for saving video game data on a computer. We then researched different methods and technologies that could be used for this purpose, such as using local storage or cloud storage. After discussing the pros and cons of each option, we ultimately decided on a solution that would be most effective and efficient for their needs. Our group then implemented this solution, testing it to ensure that it was able to successfully save and retrieve video game data as desired. Through our work, we were able to develop a system for saving video game data on a computer that was both effective and reliable.
